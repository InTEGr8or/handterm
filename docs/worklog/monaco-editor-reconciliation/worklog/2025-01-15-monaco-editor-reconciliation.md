  - [x] Add type mapping for GitHub's 'blob' and 'tree' types to internal 'file' and 'directory' types
  - [x] Add keyboard controls for tree navigation
  - [x] Create a Playwright test that loads a mock file tree and verifies navigation.
- [ ] Restore file editing functionality
- [ ] Restore file saving implementation
  - [ ] Restore GitHub save functionality
  - [ ] Verify save integration with GitHubCommand
- [ ] Verify MonacoEditor functionality matches github-save version
  - [ ] Verify Vim mode integration
  - [ ] Test all editor modes
- [ ] Update related files to match new implementation
- [ ] Test MonacoEditor integration with other components
  - [ ] Test with GitHubCommand
  - [ ] Test with CommandContext
- [ ] Document changes and update component documentation
  - [ ] Update MonacoEditor.md
  - [ ] Add Vim mode documentation

## Current Status
- Updated window.d.ts with proper Monaco editor type definitions
- Made monacoEditor property optional
- Added type safety for common editor operations:
  - getValue()
  - setValue()
  - focus()
  - updateOptions()
  - onDidChangeModelContent()
  - getModel()
- Maintained compatibility with existing type imports
- Preserved global declaration structure

Next Steps:
1. Create Playwright test for localStorage tree view loading
2. Implement tree view rendering in MonacoEditor component
3. Verify proper type checking across the application

## Investigation
1. Verified MonacoEditor.tsx implementation:
   - Has proper localStorage reading via useEffect
   - Includes validation for tree items structure
   - Formats content using formatTreeContent utility
   - Handles tree navigation with key bindings
   - Maps GitHub types ('blob'/'tree') to internal types ('file'/'directory')
2. Identified key issues:
   - Dual source of truth between props.treeItems and localTreeItems state
   - showTreeView state not properly synchronized with isTreeView prop
   - expandedFolders state not being properly updated
   - Limited error handling for localStorage parsing
   - No visual feedback for loading/error states
   - Possible prop passing issues in test environment
3. Verified test setup:
   - Properly sets mock data in localStorage using page.addInitScript()
   - Has correct assertions for tree structure display
4. Proposed solution:
   - Consolidate tree items state into single source
   - Synchronize showTreeView with isTreeView prop
   - Fix expandedFolders state management
   - Add loading/error states
   - Improve localStorage error handling

## Progress
1. Added debug logging to MonacoEditor to track:
   - isTreeView prop value
   - localStorage data retrieval
   - Tree items parsing and validation
   - State updates
2. Exposed Monaco editor instance to window.monacoEditor for testing:
   - Added window.monacoEditor assignment in handleEditorDidMount
   - Updated Window interface in window.d.ts to include monacoEditor

## Next Steps
1. Add test case to verify debug output
2. Add error handling for localStorage parsing
3. Add visual feedback for loading/error states
4. Ensure proper cleanup of localStorage between tests
5. Verify component props in test environment

## Test Plan

- [x] Created Playwright test that:
  - Sets up mock tree data in localStorage
  - Verifies MonacoEditor loads and displays the tree structure
  - Verifies localStorage was set correctly
  - Verifies MonacoEditor props
  - Verifies editor content and tree structure
  - Includes debug log verification
  - Handles empty localStorage case
  - Handles malformed localStorage data
  - Cleans up localStorage between tests
- [x] Added test case to verify:
  - Monaco editor instance availability via window.monacoEditor
  - Tree structure rendering from localStorage data
  - File content display in editor
  - Basic tree navigation functionality

### Type Safety Improvements
- Added WindowWithEditor interface to properly type window.monacoEditorRef
- Removed all 'any' type usage in test file
- Added null checks for editor instance
- Updated file selection test to use typed window property

### Next Steps
- Implement tree view display in MonacoEditor component
  - Add useEffect hook to load localStorage data
  - Create tree view formatting logic
  - Add keyboard navigation handlers
  - Implement file selection callback
- Update MonacoEditor component documentation
- Add error handling for localStorage parsing
- Add visual feedback for loading/error states
