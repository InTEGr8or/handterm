# Test Description Parsing Investigation and Work Item

## Objective
Enhance the current test description parsing system to support Gherkin-like syntax for tutorial progression testing in Handterm.

## Update: Vitest Cucumber Plugin Discovery
A potential solution has been identified: [vitest-cucumber_rtl_template](https://github.com/Agriculture-Intelligence/vitest-cucumber_rtl_template)

### Plugin Characteristics
- Specifically designed for Vitest and React Testing Library
- Provides Cucumber-like syntax for test descriptions
- Potentially reduces need for custom parsing implementation

## Current State
- Existing `testDescriptionParser.ts` is a minimal placeholder
- No actual parsing or test generation functionality implemented
- Goal: Create a robust, flexible test description parsing system for Vitest

## Recommended Approach for Tutorial Progression Testing

### Test Description Format
```gherkin
Scenario: Tutorial Initial Progression
Given the user is in the tutorial mode
When the user types "Enter"
And the user types "fdsa"
And the user types "jkl;"
Then the tutorial should progress successfully
```

### Implementation Strategies
1. Evaluate Vitest Cucumber Plugin:
   - Assess compatibility with project requirements
   - Test integration with existing test infrastructure
   - Verify performance and type safety

2. Alternative: Custom Parser
   - If plugin doesn't meet all requirements
   - Implement type-safe parsing logic
   - Generate Vitest test cases dynamically

## Scope
- Investigate Vitest Cucumber plugin
- Validate plugin's suitability for tutorial progression testing
- Implement or adapt test description parsing mechanism

## Tasks
- [ ] Review Vitest Cucumber plugin documentation
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept test using the plugin
- [ ] Assess plugin's compatibility with project needs
- [ ] If suitable, integrate plugin
- [ ] If not suitable, design custom parsing mechanism
- [ ] Write initial tutorial progression test scenarios

## Alternatives Considered
- SpecFlow: Not ideal for TypeScript/React
- Cucumber.js: Possible, but adds complexity
- Custom parser: Fallback option if plugin doesn't meet needs
- **New Option**: Vitest Cucumber Plugin

## Acceptance Criteria
- Can parse Gherkin-like test descriptions
- Generates valid Vitest test cases
- Supports tutorial progression testing
- Provides clear error messages and logging
- Maintains type safety

## Potential Challenges
- Plugin compatibility
- Potential need for custom extensions
- Learning curve of new testing approach

## Potential Risks
- Plugin may not fully meet project-specific requirements
- Potential performance overhead
- Integration complexity

## Priority
High - Critical for improving test coverage and developer experience

## Recommendation
Evaluate the Vitest Cucumber plugin as a potential solution for implementing Gherkin-like test descriptions. If it meets the project's requirements, integrate it. Otherwise, fall back to a custom parsing implementation.
