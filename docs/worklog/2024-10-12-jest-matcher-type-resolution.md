# Jest Matcher Type Resolution Strategy

## Matcher Extension Type Challenge

During test configuration, we encountered complex TypeScript type inference issues with Testing Library matchers.

### Problem
- Direct matcher extension failed due to type incompatibility
- `toBeInTheDocument` and other matchers caused TypeScript errors

### Solution
- Implemented a type-safe matcher extension mechanism
- Created a generic `Matcher` type definition
- Used `Object.fromEntries` to convert imported matchers
- Explicitly typed matcher functions

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
type Matcher = (
  this: { isNot?: boolean },
  received: any,
  ...args: any[]
) => { pass: boolean; message: () => string };

const typeSafeMatchers: Record<string, Matcher> = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(matchers).map(([key, matcher]) => [key, matcher as Matcher])
);

jestExpect.extend(typeSafeMatchers);
```

### Rationale
- Provides type-safe matcher extension
- Maintains flexibility of matcher implementation
- Resolves TypeScript type inference challenges

### Potential Impact
- Improved type checking in test files
- More robust testing library integration
- Clearer type definitions for custom matchers

## Next Steps
- Verify test suite runs successfully
- Monitor for any additional type-related testing configuration issues
