# 2025-01-16 Monaco Editor Linting Fixes

## Task
Fix linting issues in MonacoEditor.tsx to comply with strict type checking rules

## Problem
The file had multiple violations of @typescript-eslint/strict-boolean-expressions and a missing dependency in a useEffect hook:
1. Implicit boolean checks using truthy/falsy values
2. Missing 'value' dependency in editor initialization useEffect
3. Potential null reference issues

## Solution
1. Replaced all implicit boolean checks with explicit null checks using `!= null`
2. Added 'value' to the useEffect dependencies array
3. Maintained existing functionality while improving type safety

## Next Steps
1. Verify editor functionality in the application
2. Check for any regressions in Vim mode or tree view
3. Review related components for similar linting issues
