# 2025-01-19 LoginCommand Test Linting Fixes

## Task
Fix linting errors in `src/commands/__tests__/LoginCommand.test.tsx`

## Understanding the Problem
1. Need to resolve all ESLint errors while maintaining test functionality
2. Must follow strict TypeScript rules from .eslintrc.cjs
3. Test files have some relaxed rules but still need to maintain type safety

## Plan
1. Read and analyze the current linting errors
2. Fix type-related issues first (strict-boolean-expressions, explicit types)
3. Address any React/JSX specific issues
4. Ensure test functionality remains intact
5. Document fixes in this worklog

## Next Steps
1. Read LoginCommand.test.tsx to identify specific linting errors
2. Begin fixing type-related issues
