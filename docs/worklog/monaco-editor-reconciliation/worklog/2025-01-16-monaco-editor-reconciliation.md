# 2025-01-16 Monaco Editor Reconciliation

## Task
Refactor MonacoEditor component to use @monaco-editor/react instead of @monaco-editor/loader

## Problem Understanding
The current implementation:
1. Uses deprecated @monaco-editor/loader package
2. Manually manages editor lifecycle
3. Has complex initialization logic
4. Needs to maintain existing Vim mode and tree view functionality

## Plan
1. Replace loader-based initialization with @monaco-editor/react
2. Use Editor component with proper props
3. Maintain Vim mode integration
4. Keep tree view functionality
5. Ensure proper cleanup
6. Follow eslint rules

## Next Steps
1. Create new MonacoEditor component using @monaco-editor/react
2. Implement Vim mode integration
3. Add tree view support
4. Handle cleanup
5. Test implementation
