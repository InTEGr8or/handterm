# Coding Standards

## Tech Stack

Vite, TypeScript, React, `@xterm/xterm`, Monacaco editor, web-based TUI developed in VS Code & WSL Terminal.

## Priorities

* Robust, expert-level React implementation. 
* Prefer functional components and other modern React best practices.
* The `HandTerm.tsx` was converted from a very large JavaScript class, so it is currently a class component, but we want to do whatever we can to incrementally and carefully convert it to a React functional component.
