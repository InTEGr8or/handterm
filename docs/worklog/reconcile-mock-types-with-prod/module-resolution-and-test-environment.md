## Phase 5: Module Resolution and Test Environment
- [x] Fix module resolution in tests
  - [x] Identify all test files using 'src/types/Types' (No files found using this import path)
  - [ ] Update imports to use @handterm/types
  - [ ] Or create proper re-exports from old location
- [x] Verify test environment setup (Resolved terminal initialization timing issues)
  - [x] Check module resolution configuration (Proper paths configured in tsconfig.json)
  - [x] Ensure proper TypeScript paths (@handterm/types path correctly mapped)
  - [x] Validate test runner configuration (Playwright and Vitest configs properly set up)
- [x] Establish migration validation
  - [x] Add tests to verify type exports (Added signal.test.ts)
  - [x] Create type compatibility tests (Included in signal.test.ts)
  - [x] Add regression tests for module imports (Verified in signal.test.ts)
