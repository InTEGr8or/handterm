# Active Context

## Current Focus

Linting and testing.

To involve additional developers, we need productive linting rules that prevent code smells and encourage best practices for this tech stack.

To make sure the project moves in the right direction, we need a solid e2e test suite primarily. Unit tests should be implemented wherever they improve the development process or solve code robustness issues.

## Recent Changes

Some changes have been made to the `.eslintrc.cjs` to apply a better long range linting strategy.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Get the current `npm run test:e2e` tests working again.
