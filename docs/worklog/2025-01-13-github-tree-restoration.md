# GitHub Tree View Restoration - 2025-01-13

## Task
Restore GitHub tree view functionality in MonacoEditor.tsx from commit 9a487aa3bc01e0981ee9d43151dcd5bcb9c389b3

## Problem Analysis
The current MonacoEditor.tsx has lost key GitHub tree view functionality including:
1. Tree navigation with j/k keys
2. File selection with Enter key
3. Directory expansion/collapse
4. Vim-style keybindings
5. GitHub file saving integration

## Plan
1. Restore tree navigation keybindings
2. Implement directory expansion logic
3. Restore GitHub file saving integration
4. Add back Vim-style keybindings
5. Ensure S3 file editing functionality remains intact

## Next Steps
1. Analyze diff to identify key functionality to restore
2. Implement tree navigation keybindings
3. Add directory expansion logic
4. Restore GitHub file saving
5. Add Vim keybindings
6. Test with both GitHub and S3 files
