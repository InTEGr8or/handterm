## Canvas Mock Type Resolution Strategy

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Implemented type-safe canvas mocking utility
- [x] Resolved TypeScript type resolution warnings
- [x] Created comprehensive type declarations
- [x] Addressed linting and type checking challenges

### Type Resolution Approach
- Added explicit type export for `CanvasMock`
- Used `ReturnType` to derive type from `setupCanvasMock()`
- Created detailed type interfaces for mock objects

### Key Modifications
- Updated `canvasMock.ts` to export `CanvasMock` type
- Enhanced `canvasMock.d.ts` with precise type definitions
- Modified test files to use new type imports

### Challenges Addressed
- Implicit 'any' type warnings in test files
- Lack of type safety in canvas mocking
- Complex type inference for test utilities

### Technical Strategies
- Explicit type annotations
- Flexible type handling
- Gradual type safety improvements

### Type Interfaces Created
- `MockCanvasContext`: Defines mock canvas context methods
- `CanvasMock`: Describes canvas mocking utility structure

### Next Steps
- [ ] Continue improving type safety
- [ ] Expand type coverage for test utilities
- [ ] Reduce reliance on type assertions

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of precise type declarations
- Balancing type strictness with test utility flexibility
- Leveraging TypeScript's type inference capabilities
