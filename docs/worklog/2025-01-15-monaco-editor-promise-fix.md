# 2025-01-15 Monaco Editor Promise Handling Fix

## Task
Fix ESLint error in MonacoEditor.tsx by properly handling the Promise from loader.init()

## Problem
The code was not properly handling the Promise returned by loader.init(), which could lead to uncaught errors and violated ESLint rules.

## Solution
1. Added explicit void operator to indicate we're intentionally not awaiting the Promise
2. Added error handling with .catch() to log any initialization failures
3. Added proper cleanup in the useEffect return function

## Changes Made
- Wrapped loader.init() in void operator
- Added .catch() with error logging
- Added proper cleanup of editor and vim instances

## Next Steps
- Commit changes with detailed commit message
- Verify fix resolves ESLint warning
- Test editor initialization with error cases
