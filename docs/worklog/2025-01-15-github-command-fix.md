# GitHub Command Fix Worklog

## Task
Restore GitHub command functionality to load repository tree view into MonacoEditor element.

## Current Understanding
- The GitHub command should display repository contents in a tree view
- Users can navigate with j/k keys and load files with ENTER
- Functionality was working in `github-save` commit
- Current error suggests module export/import issues

## Investigation Findings
1. Initial assumption was CommandContext issues based on error message
2. User clarified existing CommandProvider and useCommand hook are working
3. Need to focus specifically on GitHubCommand implementation

## Next Steps
1. Examine GitHubCommand.ts implementation
2. Verify tree view rendering logic
3. Check MonacoEditor integration
4. Test repository loading functionality
5. Fix any broken imports or exports

## Plan
- Focus on restoring existing functionality rather than creating new components
- Use existing command infrastructure (CommandProvider, useCommand)
- Verify GitHub API integration
- Ensure proper tree view rendering in MonacoEditor
