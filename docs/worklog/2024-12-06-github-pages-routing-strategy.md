# GitHub Pages Routing Strategy Refinement

## Problem
Client-side routes were not working correctly when deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Solution
Maintained browser routing with 404.html redirect strategy.

## Rationale
- Preserved existing custom location parsing logic
- Avoided breaking changes to navigation utilities
- Implemented server-side redirect for SPA routing

## Key Changes
- Reverted to `createBrowserRouter`
- Retained 404.html redirect mechanism
- Kept existing routing and navigation implementations intact

## Recommended Deployment Approach
1. Ensure 404.html is deployed with the application
2. Configure GitHub Pages to use the root directory
3. Verify routing works across all paths
