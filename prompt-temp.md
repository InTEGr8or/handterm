/ask I know that the typical React tendency is to move state up, but is there any case to move state down? I am wondering if there might be a reason to move `commandLine` state down to `XtermAdapter`. We will be integrating `useCommandHistory`, and I am wondering if there might be any reason to keep that closer to the `XtermAdapter` level of processing. Or would it be better to centralize user-centric logic like that in the `HandTermWrapper`?
