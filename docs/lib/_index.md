1. **Set up Amazon Cognito User Pool:**
   - Create a user pool as before, but you can skip configuring third-party providers.
   - Enforce password policies such as minimum length and character requirements directly within Cognito settings.

2. **Implement Command-Line Login:**
   - In your TUI, prompt the user for their username and password.
   - Use a masked input for the password to prevent it from being displayed as they type.
   - Call Amazon Cognito APIs to authenticate the user with the provided credentials.

3. **Secure Transmission:**
   - Ensure your application communicates with Amazon Cognito over HTTPS to keep the username and password secure during transmission.

4. **Handle Authentication Tokens:**
   - On successful authentication, store the Cognito tokens securely within the user's session.
   - Use these tokens to access AWS resources.

5. **Interact with AWS Services:**
   - Use the Cognito tokens as before to interact with DynamoDB or S3.
   - Store or retrieve user data based on the authenticated user identity.

6. **Implement Logout Functionality:**
   - Provide a command that allows users to log out, which should invalidate the session tokens.

```ts
Cognito: {

   authenticationFlowType: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',
   region: 'us-east-1',
   userPoolId: 'us-east-1_apGvoR62E',
   userPoolWebClientId: '776i4gt2nij7ce30m9jlo9fcq0',
}
