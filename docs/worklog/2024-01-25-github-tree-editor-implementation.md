# GitHub Tree Editor Implementation

## Added GitHub File Saving

Added the ability to save files back to GitHub when editing files from the GitHub tree view. Key changes:

1. Added `saveRepoFile` endpoint to `apiClient.ts`:
   - Takes repo, path, content, and commit message
   - Returns commit and content SHA information
   - Handles GitHub authentication errors

2. Enhanced MonacoEditor to support GitHub saving:
   - Stores current repo/path in localStorage when file is selected
   - Split save functionality into local and GitHub saves:
     - Local auto-save for every change (localStorage)
     - GitHub save only triggered by vim commands (:w, :wq)
   - Provides feedback through console logs
   - Handles errors gracefully

3. Integration points:
   - Tree view stores file path when selecting a file
   - Editor checks if file is from GitHub before saving
   - Uses existing auth system for GitHub API calls

This enables a seamless editing experience where files opened from the GitHub tree view can be saved back to their source repository, while maintaining proper save behavior (auto-save locally, explicit save to GitHub).
