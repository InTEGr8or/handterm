title: Improve TerminalPage Logging
---

# Task
Improve the logging in the `waitForTutorialMode` function of `src/e2e/page-objects/TerminalPage.ts` to log DOM nodes inside `div#handterm-wrapper` that have IDs. Also, improve code readability, maintainability, performance, best practices, and error handling in the function.

# Understanding
The user wants to enhance the `waitForTutorialMode` function in `TerminalPage.ts` to provide more detailed debugging information by logging specific DOM elements. The current logging is basic and the user is asking for improvements in several areas, including code quality and error handling.

# Plan
1. **Analyze the existing `waitForTutorialMode` function**: Understand its current functionality and identify areas for improvement.
2. **Implement DOM node logging**: Add code to select the `div#handterm-wrapper` and log its descendant elements that have IDs. Use `page.evaluate` to run JavaScript in the browser context to achieve this.
3. **Improve code readability and maintainability**: Refactor the logging code to be more concise and easier to understand. Add comments to explain the purpose of the new logging logic.
4. **Performance optimization**: Ensure the DOM node logging is efficient and does not significantly impact test performance. Select only necessary elements.
5. **Best practices and patterns**: Apply best practices for logging and error handling in Playwright tests.
6. **Error handling and edge cases**: Ensure the logging code handles cases where `div#handterm-wrapper` or elements with IDs are not found.
7. **Update `TerminalPage.ts`**: Use `apply_diff` to apply the improved logging code to the `waitForTutorialMode` function in `TerminalPage.ts`.
8. **Document the changes**: Add comments to the code and update the worklog file with explanations of the improvements.

# Next Steps
1. Read `src/e2e/page-objects/TerminalPage.ts` to analyze the `waitForTutorialMode` function.
2. Implement the DOM node logging and other improvements in the function.
3. Apply the changes to `TerminalPage.ts` using `apply_diff`.
4. Document the changes in the worklog file and in code comments.
