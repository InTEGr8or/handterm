# Install Playwright MCP Server

## Task
Install an MCP server that provides Playwright automation capabilities.

## Problem Understanding
- Need to create a new MCP server that wraps Playwright functionality
- Server should provide tools for browser automation beyond what the current browser_action tool offers
- Must be configured in the MCP settings file

## Plan
1. Create a new Playwright MCP server project
2. Implement browser automation tools
3. Configure the server in MCP settings

## Implementation
1. Found existing Playwright MCP server implementation with:
   - playwright_navigate tool for URL navigation
   - playwright_screenshot tool for taking page screenshots
2. Installed Playwright browser dependencies
3. Added server configuration to MCP settings file

## Result
Successfully installed and configured the Playwright MCP server. The server provides two tools:
- playwright_navigate: Navigate to URLs using Playwright
- playwright_screenshot: Capture screenshots of the current page
