# 2025-01-19 Edit Command Feature

## Type Resolution Fix

Resolved type conflict between window.d.ts and monaco-editor types by:

1. Updating window.d.ts to use consistent MonacoTypes.editor.IStandaloneCodeEditor
2. Verified all references to IStandaloneCodeEditor across the codebase
3. Confirmed monaco.d.ts extensions are compatible
4. Validated HandTermPage.ts usage

All type references are now consistent and the type resolution issue is resolved.
