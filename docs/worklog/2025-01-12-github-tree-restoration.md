# 2025-01-12 GitHub Tree Restoration Worklog

## Task
Restore GitHub tree view navigation functionality from commit 9a487aa3bc01e0981ee9d43151dcd5bcb9c389b3

## Understanding
The MonacoEditor component previously had working tree navigation features that were lost. Need to:
1. Review old commit files
2. Diff changes
3. Restore tree navigation functionality
4. Ensure S3 editing capabilities remain intact

## Plan
1. Fix TypeScript/ESLint errors in MonacoEditor.tsx
2. Test tree navigation functionality
3. Compare with old commit to identify missing features
4. Implement any missing tree navigation features

## Next Steps
- [x] Fix TypeScript/ESLint errors
- [ ] Compare with old commit
- [ ] Implement missing features
- [ ] Test tree navigation

## Current Problem
Accidentally ran `npm run dev` which violates .clinerules by attaching to terminal. Need to:
1. Stop the running process
2. Find alternative way to test changes
