# GitHub Device Poll Token Storage Enhancement

## Context
Modified the GitHub device polling Lambda function to directly save GitHub authentication tokens and user information to Cognito during the device flow authentication process.

## Key Changes
- Integrated token storage directly into the device polling Lambda
- Removed dependency on a separate token saving Lambda
- Enhanced security by handling token storage server-side

## Implementation Details
- Extracts Cognito user ID from request context
- Retrieves GitHub access token during device flow
- Fetches additional GitHub user information
- Updates Cognito user attributes with:
  - GitHub access token
  - Token expiration time
  - GitHub username
  - GitHub user ID

## Improvements
- Simplified authentication flow
- More secure token handling
- Reduced number of Lambda function calls
- Consistent user attribute updates

## Potential Future Enhancements
- Implement more robust error handling
- Add logging for authentication attempts
- Create mechanism for token refresh
- Develop comprehensive unit tests for the authentication process

## Rationale
By integrating token storage directly into the device polling process, we:
- Reduce complexity in the authentication flow
- Ensure immediate and secure storage of GitHub credentials
- Provide a more streamlined user experience during GitHub account linking
