title: Monaco Editor Reconciliation

---

use `docs/worklog/2025-01-15-monaco-editor-reconciliation.md` as the worklog.

Read the `src/components/MonacoEditor.md` for a brief description of the Monaco Editor component.

We had a working Monaco file editor in this project in the `github-save` commit.

I've created a git diff of the older working file with the new current `MonacoEditor.tsx` here: `temp/monaco_9a487aa3bc01e0981ee9d43151dcd5bcb9c389b3_HEAD.diff`.

I need your help reconciling how the old file worked with the new linted-but-not-working Monaco editor.

We were using `import Editor, { Monaco } from "@monaco-editor/react";` in the old version, as can be seen in the `diff`.

That import refers to a React Typescript Monaco library from Qovery that is used in this project/file `/home/mstouffer/repos/handterm-proj/console/libs/shared/ui/src/lib/components/code-editor/code-editor.tsx`, and this one: `/home/mstouffer/repos/handterm-proj/console/libs/shared/ui/src/lib/components/code-editor/code-editor.tsx`

The Qovery library looks like it follows best practices and is very React-friendly and it is recent. I think we have had the best experience with it, compared to all our other attempts at implementing Monaco in our `HandTerm` project.

I need your help reconciling the the diffed MonacoEditor with our current version and help me get it to work like the `github-save` version did.

That means we will probably have to edit related files to, and we can refer to the files in the older commit to do that. You can use the command line to create diffs on related files using the same naming convention that I used for the `MonacoEditor.tsx` diff.

Read your `.clinerules` and custom instructions before proceeding.
