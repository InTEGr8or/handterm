## Core Philosophy

This ESLint configuration represents our gold standard for code quality. We deliberately configure rules to enforce best practices, rather than accommodating existing patterns. When encountering linting errors, the solution is to improve the code to meet our standards, not to relax the rules.

Key principles:
1. Type safety is non-negotiable
2. Explicit is better than implicit
3. Consistency across the codebase
4. No unsafe operations
5. Clean and maintainable code
6. Refine linting rules for the project-specific tech stack.
