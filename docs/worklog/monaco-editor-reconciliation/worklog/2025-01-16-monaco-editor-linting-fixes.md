# 2025-01-16 MonacoEditor Linting Fixes

## Task
Fix linting issues in the MonacoEditor component based on the reconciliation work documented in cline_docs/tasks/2025-01-15-monaco-editor-reconciliation.md

## Problem Understanding
The current MonacoEditor implementation has several linting issues that need to be addressed:
1. Type safety concerns with the editor type references
2. Missing type annotations for callback parameters
3. Potential null reference issues with vimModeRef
4. Inconsistent type imports from monaco-editor

## Plan
1. Add proper type imports from monaco-editor
2. Add type annotations for all callback parameters
3. Add null checks for vimModeRef usage
4. Ensure all types are properly imported and used

## Next Steps
1. Add proper type imports from monaco-editor
2. Fix the editor type references in handleEditorDidMount
3. Add null checks for vimModeRef operations
4. Add type annotations for all callback parameters
