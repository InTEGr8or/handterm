# GitHub Command Navigation Worklog
Date: 2025-01-17

## Task Description
The GitHubCommand `github -t` should:
1. Load one level of the GitHub tree of a repo into localStorage
2. Use navigationUtils to navigate to a URL with `activity=tree` in the querystring parameters

Current issues:
- The `navigate` command is not working as expected
- The e2e test in `e2e/monaco-tree-view.spec.ts` is not detecting `activity=tree` in querystring parameters

## Plan
1. Investigate GitHubCommand.ts implementation
2. Examine navigationUtils functionality
3. Review e2e test cases in monaco-tree-view.spec.ts
4. Fix navigation functionality
5. Update tests to verify correct behavior

## Worklog
- [x] Added navigationUtils.js to tsconfig.eslint.json include patterns
- [ ] Initial investigation of GitHubCommand.ts
- [ ] Review navigationUtils implementation
- [ ] Analyze e2e test failures
- [ ] Implement fixes
- [ ] Verify test coverage
