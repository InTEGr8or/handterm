- [ ] Document changes and update component documentation
  - [ ] Update MonacoEditor.md
  - [ ] Add Vim mode documentation

## Current Status
- GitHubCommand.tsx successfully loads file tree into localStorage as `github_tree_items`
- MonacoEditor.tsx now properly:
  - Types the navigation history state
  - Handles errors safely with proper type checking
  - Maintains tree view state correctly
  - Updates when localStorage changes

## Changes Made
1. Added NavigationState interface for history tracking
2. Created typed useRef for history array
3. Improved error handling with proper type guards
4. Fixed TypeScript errors in error handling code

## Test Implementation
- Created Playwright test file `e2e/monaco-tree-view.spec.ts`
- Added mock tree data setup in localStorage
- Implemented test scenarios:
  - Tree view structure verification
  - Directory navigation
  - Error handling for invalid data

## Tree Formatter Analysis
- Navigation instructions in treeFormatter don't match actual keybindings
- getItemAtLine might have issues with duplicate names
- Need to:
  1. Update navigation instructions to match actual keybindings
  2. Improve getItemAtLine to handle duplicate names

## Test Execution Status
- Playwright tests failing due to tree view toggle not being found
- Debugging steps:
  - Verify localStorage data is being properly loaded
  - Check MonacoEditor component initialization
  - Ensure tree view toggle is properly rendered
  - Add debug logging to track component state
    - Debug logging already implemented in updateTreeData function:
      - Logs when function is called
      - Logs retrieved localStorage data
      - Logs when no tree items are found
- Current issues:
  - Tree view toggle not rendering
  - Component not responding to localStorage changes
  - Navigation controls not appearing
  - Playwright tests timing out waiting for Monaco editor to load
    - Need to investigate editor initialization in test environment
    - Add proper wait conditions and debug logging
    - Verify Monaco editor web worker setup in tests
