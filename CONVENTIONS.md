Check `pwd` to determine which project you're running CLI commands in.

Create ONE work item description file per conversation in `docs/worklog/`. If the user does not pass in a `DATE: <todays-date>` value, use `date "+%Y-%m-%d"` to get the local system date to use along with a task title you creat in the file name.

Specify the intended work with checkboxes and update the checkboxes or modify the changes _after_ any successes, such as solved linting or solved tests.
