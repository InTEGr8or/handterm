# GitHub Tree Mode Fix

## Task
Fix GitHubCommand tree mode functionality that stopped working after recent changes.

## Problem Understanding
- The GitHubCommand successfully fetches and stores tree data in github_tree_items
- The tree is not being displayed or made interactive for file selection
- This is a regression as it previously worked

## Plan
1. Examine GitHubCommand.ts to understand tree rendering logic
2. Identify where the rendering pipeline might be failing
3. Fix the rendering logic while maintaining TUI paradigm
4. Ensure linting rules are followed

## Next Steps
- Read and analyze GitHubCommand.ts
- Identify the rendering logic for the tree
- Determine why the tree is not being displayed
