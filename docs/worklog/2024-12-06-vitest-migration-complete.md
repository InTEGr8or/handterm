# Comprehensive Vitest Migration for HandTerm Project

## Migration Overview
Successfully migrated the project's testing infrastructure from Jest to Vitest, addressing multiple configuration and compatibility challenges.

## Key Achievements
- Converted all test files to Vitest-compatible format
- Resolved module resolution and import conflicts
- Maintained existing test coverage and logic
- Simplified testing configuration

## Migration Stages
1. Initial Configuration
   - Updated Vite and Vitest configuration
   - Removed Jest-specific dependencies
   - Configured module resolution

2. Test File Migration
   - Converted imports to Vitest syntax
   - Updated mocking strategies
   - Ensured type compatibility
   - Preserved existing test logic

3. Configuration Refinement
   - Cleaned up global testing configurations
   - Removed Jest-specific global imports
   - Implemented framework-native testing approaches

## Challenges Addressed
- Complex testing framework dependencies
- Module import and resolution issues
- Inconsistent testing approaches
- Type declaration conflicts

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of systematic framework migration
- Benefits of framework-native testing tools
- Need for comprehensive configuration management

## Recommendations for Future
- Regularly update testing dependencies
- Maintain consistent testing strategies
- Continue expanding test coverage
- Monitor testing performance and reliability

## Final Test Suite Status
- Total Test Files: 5
- Total Tests: 7
- Result: All Tests Passed âœ“

## Next Steps
- Conduct thorough manual testing
- Expand test coverage
- Optimize testing performance
