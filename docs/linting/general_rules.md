## General Rules

These rules apply to general JavaScript and TypeScript code and are not specific to React or TypeScript. They help enforce best practices for code quality, maintainability, and error prevention.

### Overview

General rules cover a wide range of coding practices, including:
- Consistent return statements
- Avoiding console logs in production
- Preventing debugger statements in production

### `consistent-return`

-   **Current Setting:** `'error'`
-   **Rationale:** Requires that functions have consistent return statements, either always returning a value or never returning a value.
-   **Why This Matters:**
    - Prevents unexpected behavior due to implicit returns
    - Improves code clarity and predictability
    - Helps catch potential errors early
-   **AirBNB:** Also enabled.
-   **Recommendation:** Keep this rule as is.
-   **Examples:**

```typescript
// BAD: Inconsistent return
function myFunction(condition: boolean) {
  if (condition) {
    return 10;
  }
  // Implicit return of undefined
}

// GOOD: Consistent return
function myFunction(condition: boolean): number | undefined {
  if (condition) {
    return 10;
  }
  return undefined;
}

// GOOD: Consistent return (void function)
function myFunction(condition: boolean): void {
  if (condition) {
    console.log(10);
    return;
  }
  console.log(20);
}
```

### `no-console`

-   **Current Setting:** `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'error' : 'warn'`
-   **Rationale:** Disallows the use of `console` statements in production builds, but allows them in development.
-   **Why This Matters:**
    - Prevents sensitive information from being logged in production
    - Reduces noise in production logs
    - Encourages using proper logging mechanisms
-   **AirBNB:** Also enabled, but with a more strict `'error'` setting.
-   **Recommendation:** Keep this rule as is. The current setting allows for debugging during development while preventing console logs in production.
-   **Examples:**

```typescript
// BAD: Console log in production
function myFunction() {
  console.log('This should not be in production');
}

// GOOD: No console logs in production
function myFunction() {
  // Use a proper logging mechanism instead
}
```

### `no-debugger`

-   **Current Setting:** `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'error' : 'warn'`
-   **Rationale:** Disallows the use of `debugger` statements in production builds, but allows them in development.
-   **Why This Matters:**
    - Prevents accidental breakpoints in production
    - Ensures that debugging code is not included in production builds
    - Improves overall code quality
-   **AirBNB:** Also enabled, but with a more strict `'error'` setting.
-   **Recommendation:** Keep this rule as is. The current setting allows for debugging during development while preventing debugger statements in production.
-   **Examples:**

```typescript
// BAD: Debugger statement in production
function myFunction() {
  debugger; // This should not be in production
}

// GOOD: No debugger statements in production
function myFunction() {
  // Use proper debugging tools instead
}
```

### Best Practices and Recommendations

1. **Consistent Returns**
   - Ensure that all functions have consistent return statements.
   - If a function can return a value, it should always return a value.
   - If a function does not return a value, it should be explicitly declared as `void`.

2. **Avoid Console Logs in Production**
   - Use proper logging mechanisms for production environments.
   - Remove or disable console logs before deploying to production.

3. **Remove Debugger Statements**
   - Ensure that no debugger statements are left in production code.
   - Use proper debugging tools during development.

### Conclusion

General rules are essential for maintaining a clean, consistent, and error-free codebase. By following these guidelines, you can improve the overall quality and maintainability of your project.
