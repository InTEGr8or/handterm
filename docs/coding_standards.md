# Coding Standards

## Tech Stack

Vite, TypeScript, React, `@xterm/xterm`, Monacaco editor, web-based TUI developed in VS Code & WSL Terminal.

## Priorities

* Robust, expert-level React implementation. 
* Prefer functional components and other modern React best practices.
* use `props` interfaces and don't destructure `props`. We want clarity on when a `prop` is being used.
* Always prefer to move code in the functional direction and to use `hooks` when most appropriate.
