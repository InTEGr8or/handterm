# 2025-01-11 Fix Token Refresh Loop

## Task
Fix the token refresh loop error:
```
[2025-01-11T00:07:49.811Z] [Auth] [ERROR] Token validation failed: No refresh token
```

## Problem Understanding
The auth system is stuck in a loop trying to refresh tokens but failing because no refresh token is available. This suggests either:
1. The refresh token is not being stored properly
2. The refresh token is being cleared prematurely
3. Error handling for missing refresh tokens is insufficient

## Plan
1. Analyze useAuth.ts to understand token refresh logic
2. Identify where refresh tokens are stored/retrieved
3. Add proper error handling for missing refresh tokens
4. Implement graceful fallback when refresh tokens are unavailable

## Next Steps
1. Read CONVENTIONS.md
2. Analyze useAuth.ts implementation
3. Identify specific areas needing improvement
