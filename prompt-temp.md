/ask I have two TUI-based activities in my HandTerm app. They both involve accepting text-based commands from the user in the terminal. Now I want them to interact, so that one activity, the Tutorial, can get to a state where it passes control to the Game activity, and then the Game can get to a state where it passes control back to the Tutorial. I don't think I want the Tutorial or the Game managing the passing of control. I probably need a mediator. What might that look like?
