## Navigation Optimization in useReactiveLocation

### Changes Made
- Added check to prevent unnecessary location updates
- Implemented `replace: true` in navigation to reduce navigation stack entries
- Improved condition for updating path and navigating

### Rationale
- Reduce frequency of navigation calls
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Minimize browser navigation throttling

### Specific Optimizations
1. Only update path signal if location has changed
2. Use `replace: true` to reduce navigation stack
3. Add explicit comparison before navigation

### Expected Outcomes
- Reduced navigation frequency
- Improved performance
- Mitigation of browser navigation throttling
