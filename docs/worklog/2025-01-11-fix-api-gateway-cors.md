# Fix API Gateway CORS Configuration

## Task
Fix CORS configuration in API Gateway to allow handterm website to make direct API calls from both local development and GitHub Pages deployment.

## Understanding

- API calls should go directly to the API Gateway endpoint
- Current CORS configuration is preventing successful API calls
- Need to configure proper CORS headers in API Gateway

## Plan
1. Examine API Gateway configuration in handterm-cdk
2. Add proper CORS headers to API Gateway configuration
3. Verify API calls work from both local development and GitHub Pages

## Next Steps
