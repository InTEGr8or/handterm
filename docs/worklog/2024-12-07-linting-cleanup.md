## Linting Cleanup Plan

### Unused Variables Strategy
- Prefix unused variables with underscore `_` to silence linter
- Remove completely unused imports
- Consider removing unused function parameters or marking them as optional

### React Hook Dependencies
- Review useEffect and useCallback hooks
- Add missing dependencies to dependency arrays
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to memoize functions and values
- Consider using `useRef` for values that shouldn't trigger re-renders

### Console Statements
- Replace `console` calls with a custom logging mechanism
- Use environment-based logging (e.g., only in development)
- Remove debug console statements in production code

### Specific Error Types
- Address constant condition warnings
- Ensure type safety in conditional statements
- Review and refactor complex conditional logic

### Recommended Tools and Techniques
- ESLint configuration updates
- TypeScript strict mode
- React Hook Lint rules
- Performance profiling

### Potential Refactoring Areas
1. Hooks with missing dependencies
2. Components with unnecessary re-renders
3. Complex conditional logic
4. Unused imports and variables

### Implementation Phases
1. Static Analysis
2. Dependency Audit
3. Logging Standardization
4. Performance Optimization
5. Code Cleanup

### Long-term Maintenance
- Regular linting and type checking
- Continuous integration checks
- Code review processes
- Developer education on best practices
