## Ignore Patterns

Ignore patterns specify files or directories that ESLint should not lint. This is useful for excluding third-party libraries, generated files, or other code that you don't want to lint.

### Overview

Ignore patterns allow you to exclude specific files or directories from ESLint's linting process. This is useful for:
- Excluding third-party libraries
- Excluding generated files
- Excluding files that are not part of the project's codebase

### Ignore Patterns Configuration

The following ignore patterns are configured in `.eslintrc.cjs`:

```javascript
ignorePatterns: [
  '@monaco-editor-react.js',
  'tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.ts'
],
```

-   **Rationale:**
    -   Excludes the `@monaco-editor-react.js` file, which is a third-party library.
    -   Excludes the `tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.ts` file, which is an example test file.
-   **Key Patterns:**
    -   `@monaco-editor-react.js`: This pattern excludes the specific file from linting.
    -   `tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.ts`: This pattern excludes the example test file from linting.

### Best Practices and Recommendations

1. **Be Specific**
   - Use specific file paths or glob patterns to target only the files you want to ignore.
   - Avoid using overly broad patterns that might exclude files you want to lint.

2. **Document Ignore Patterns**
   - Clearly document the rationale for each ignore pattern.
   - Explain why specific files or directories are excluded from linting.

3. **Keep Ignore Patterns Up-to-Date**
   - Review ignore patterns regularly to ensure they are still relevant.
   - Remove or update patterns that are no longer needed.

### Conclusion

Ignore patterns are a useful tool for customizing ESLint's linting process. By using them judiciously and documenting them clearly, you can ensure that ESLint only lints the code that you want it to lint.
