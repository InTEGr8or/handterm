title: Unify Navigation Methods
---

# Task
We need to modify the navigation system to use only the GitHub Pages compatible method (querystring `p`) even in development.

# Problem Understanding
Currently, the application uses different navigation methods in development and production:
- Development uses standard URL paths
- Production uses querystring `p` parameter due to GitHub Pages routing limitations

This dual approach is causing maintenance issues and potential bugs.

# Plan
1. Read and understand current navigation implementation in navigationUtils.ts
2. Modify the code to use only the querystring `p` method
3. Update any dependent code that uses the navigation utilities
4. Test changes in both development and production environments

# Next Steps
1. Read linting documentation
2. Analyze current navigationUtils.ts implementation
3. Implement changes to unify navigation methods
