# Jest and Testing Library Configuration Update

## Matcher Extension Challenge

During test suite execution, we encountered a TypeScript type error when extending Jest matchers from Testing Library.

### Problem
- Incorrect type definition for `toBeInTheDocument` matcher
- Incompatibility between matcher import and Jest extension

### Solution
- Import all matchers using `import * as matchers`
- Use `jestExpect.extend(matchers)` for comprehensive matcher extension
- Maintained existing global testing function extensions

### Rationale
- Ensures type-safe matcher extension
- Provides a more robust approach to testing library integration
- Preserves existing test setup infrastructure

### Potential Impact
- Improved type checking in test files
- More consistent matcher behavior across test suites

## Next Steps
- Verify test suite runs successfully
- Monitor for any additional testing configuration issues
