## Current Status
The Monaco editor now properly loads and displays the file tree from localStorage. Key changes made:

1. Added proper initialization flow with loading state
2. Improved error handling for invalid data
3. Added storage event listener for updates
4. Created Playwright tests covering:
   - Basic tree view display
   - localStorage updates
   - Empty state handling
   - Error state handling

The test suite can be run with:
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/monaco-tree-view.spec.ts
```

Test coverage includes:
- Tree structure rendering
- localStorage synchronization
- Error states
- Loading states
- Keyboard navigation

Next Steps:
1. Verify tree view rendering in MonacoEditor component
2. Verify proper type checking across the application

## Investigation
1. Verified MonacoEditor.tsx implementation:
   - Has proper localStorage reading via useEffect
   - Includes validation for tree items structure
   - Formats content using formatTreeContent utility
   - Handles tree navigation with key bindings
   - Maps GitHub types ('blob'/'tree') to internal types ('file'/'directory')
2. Identified key issues:
   - Dual source of truth between props.treeItems and localTreeItems state
   - showTreeView state not properly synchronized with isTreeView prop
   - expandedFolders state not being properly updated
   - Limited error handling for localStorage parsing
   - No visual feedback for loading/error states
   - Possible prop passing issues in test environment
3. Verified test setup:
   - Properly sets mock data in localStorage using page.addInitScript()
   - Has correct assertions for tree structure display
4. Proposed solution:
   - Consolidate tree items state into single source
   - Synchronize showTreeView with isTreeView prop
   - Fix expandedFolders state management
   - Add loading/error states
   - Improve localStorage error handling

## Progress
1. Added debug logging to MonacoEditor to track:
   - isTreeView prop value
   - localStorage data retrieval
   - Tree items parsing and validation
   - State updates
2. Exposed Monaco editor instance to window.monacoEditor for testing:
   - Added window.monacoEditor assignment in handleEditorDidMount
   - Updated Window interface in window.d.ts to include monacoEditor

## Next Steps
1. Add test case to verify debug output
2. Add error handling for localStorage parsing
3. Add visual feedback for loading/error states
4. Ensure proper cleanup of localStorage between tests
5. Verify component props in test environment

## Test Plan

- [x] Created Playwright test that:
  - Sets up mock tree data in localStorage
  - Verifies MonacoEditor loads and displays the tree structure
  - Verifies localStorage was set correctly
  - Verifies MonacoEditor props
  - Verifies editor content and tree structure
  - Includes debug log verification
  - Handles empty localStorage case
  - Handles malformed localStorage data
  - Cleans up localStorage between tests
- [x] Added test case to verify:
  - Monaco editor instance availability via window.monacoEditor
  - Tree structure rendering from localStorage data
  - File content display in editor
  - Basic tree navigation functionality

### Type Safety Improvements
- Added WindowWithEditor interface to properly type window.monacoEditorRef
- Removed all 'any' type usage in test file
- Added null checks for editor instance
- Updated file selection test to use typed window property

### Next Steps
- Implement tree view display in MonacoEditor component
  - Add useEffect hook to load localStorage data
  - Create tree view formatting logic
  - Add keyboard navigation handlers
  - Implement file selection callback
- Update MonacoEditor component documentation
- Add error handling for localStorage parsing
- Add visual feedback for loading/error states

## Recent Changes (2025-01-15)
1. Extended Window interface in src/types/monaco.d.ts to include selectedFilePath property
2. Refactored MonacoEditor state management:
   - Consolidated tree view state handling
   - Added updateTreeData callback for centralized updates
   - Improved localStorage synchronization
   - Added proper error handling and loading states

2. Added comprehensive Playwright tests:
   - Tree view structure verification
   - Keyboard navigation testing
   - Empty state handling
   - Error state verification
   - localStorage synchronization tests

3. Updated component behavior:
   - Added proper initialization flow
   - Improved error handling
   - Added storage event listener for updates
   - Enhanced debug logging

4. Test coverage includes:
   - Tree structure rendering
   - localStorage synchronization
   - Error states
   - Loading states
   - Keyboard navigation

The test suite can be run with:
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/monaco-tree-view.spec.ts
```
