## Navigation Throttling in useReactiveLocation

### Problem
- Browser is throttling navigation to prevent hanging
- Error message: "Throttling navigation to prevent the browser from hanging"
- Location: `src/hooks/useReactiveLocation.ts`

### Potential Causes
- Frequent or rapid navigation calls
- Unnecessary re-renders or navigation updates

### Proposed Solutions
- [ ] Implement debounce mechanism for navigation
- [ ] Add check to prevent unnecessary navigation updates
- [ ] Optimize `updateLocation` function to reduce navigation frequency

### Investigation Steps
1. Review current `updateLocation` implementation
2. Add logging to track navigation frequency
3. Implement debounce or throttle mechanism
4. Test and verify reduced navigation calls

### Recommended Changes
- Add a debounce mechanism to `updateLocation`
- Implement a comparison to prevent redundant navigation
