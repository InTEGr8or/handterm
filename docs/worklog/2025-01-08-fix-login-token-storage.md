# 2025-01-08 Fix Login Token Storage

## Task
Fix login token storage issues where AccessToken was not being saved to localStorage and "Invalid login response" message appeared

## Problem Understanding
1. The session validation logic in useAuth.ts had incorrect error handling
2. Token validation was failing before tokens could be stored
3. Error handling was too aggressive, removing tokens prematurely

## Changes Made
1. Fixed session validation logic to properly check status code
2. Added better error handling around token refresh attempts
3. Made token clearing more selective to only happen on definitive auth failures
4. Updated LoginCommand.ts to properly handle token storage

## Next Steps
1. Test login functionality
2. Verify tokens are properly stored in localStorage
3. Ensure error messages are appropriate
