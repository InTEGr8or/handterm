# Tutorial Transition Timing Investigation

- [x] Review tutorial.spec.ts test file
- [x] Analyze useActivityMediator.ts implementation
- [x] Investigate potential timing issues with currentTutorial ref
- [x] Implement fix for tutorial transition timing
  - Replaced computed signal with simple let variable for currentTutorial
  - Removed async/await and Promise-based transitions
  - Fixed order of operations in state updates
  - Simplified navigation to be synchronous
- [x] Verify test passes after changes

The issue was caused by several factors:
1. Using a computed signal for currentTutorial added unnecessary reactivity
2. Making transitions async/await complicated the timing
3. The order of operations was incorrect (game initialization before activity change)
4. Navigation and state updates were overly complex

The fix:
1. Simplified state management by using a let variable for currentTutorial
2. Made state transitions synchronous and direct
3. Ensured proper order: activity signal → navigation → game initialization
4. Removed unnecessary Promise-based navigation handling

The test now passes consistently, showing that the tutorial properly transitions to game mode after completing the required steps. The key insight was that simpler, synchronous state management works better in this case than trying to make everything reactive and async.
