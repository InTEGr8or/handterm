# GitHub Tree and Editor Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a GitHub file browser and editor system that allows users to navigate repository files and edit them in a Monaco editor with vim keybindings.

## Changes Made

### API Client
- Created centralized API client for GitHub operations
- Unified tree and file content fetching through getRepoTree lambda
- Added proper error handling and type safety

### Tree View
- Implemented j/k navigation
- Added folder expansion/collapse functionality
- Integrated with Monaco editor for display
- Added file icons and tree formatting

### Editor Integration
- Added automatic language detection based on file extensions
- Implemented vim mode with standard commands (w, q, wq)
- Added state management for editor content
- Integrated with location-based navigation

### State Management
- Added file path tracking in location state
- Implemented clean mode transitions (TREE ↔ EDIT ↔ NORMAL)
- Added proper cleanup on component unmount

## Known Issues

### Editor Refresh Problems
The editor currently has state management issues that need to be addressed:
1. Terminal doesn't properly reappear after closing editor
2. Need to refresh page multiple times to restore terminal
3. Unable to reopen editor through terminal after closing
4. State transitions between modes are not clean

### To Be Done
1. Fix editor state management:
   - Investigate why terminal doesn't restore properly
   - Fix editor remounting issues
   - Clean up state transitions between modes
2. Add file saving functionality:
   - Requires CDK update for GitHub file update endpoint
   - Need to implement proper error handling
   - Add success/failure notifications

## Usage

### Tree Navigation
```
j: move down
k: move up
Enter: open file or toggle folder
e: close tree view
```

### Editor Commands
```
:w - save file (when endpoint is ready)
:q - quit editor
:wq - save and quit
e - return to terminal
```

## Technical Notes
- Using Monaco editor with vim keybindings
- Tree view implemented as read-only Monaco editor
- File content fetched through lambda endpoint
- State managed through location and localStorage

## Future Improvements
1. Add file content caching
2. Implement file saving functionality
3. Add search within tree view
4. Improve state management for cleaner transitions
5. Add file modification indicators
6. Implement proper error handling for failed state transitions
