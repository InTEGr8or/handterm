## Handterm Linting Process

### Objectives
- [x] Run initial lint check
- [x] Identify and categorize linting errors
- [ ] Systematically resolve linting issues

### Linting Improvement Strategy
Date: 2024-12-07

#### Key Focus Areas
1. Type Safety
   - Replace `any` types with specific, precise types
   - Create custom interfaces and type definitions
   - Implement type guards and narrowing

2. Logging and Console Statements
   - Replace direct `console.log` and `console.error` calls
   - Implement a centralized, configurable logging utility
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging

3. React Hooks and Dependencies
   - Resolve missing and unnecessary dependencies
   - Correct hook usage patterns
   - Improve overall hook implementation

#### Prioritized Action Plan
- [ ] Audit and replace `any` types in critical files
- [ ] Create a robust logging mechanism
- [ ] Refactor React hooks for better dependency management
- [ ] Validate type safety and code quality

### Next Steps
- [ ] Systematically address linting warnings
- [ ] Implement type-safe replacements
- [ ] Run continuous type checking
- [ ] Improve overall code quality
