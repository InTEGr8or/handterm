# Tutorial Progression Testing Implementation

Work items for implementing front-end testing for tutorial progression:

- [x] Review existing test setup and configuration
- [x] Check for existing tutorial progression test implementation
- [x] Create test file for tutorial progression if needed
- [x] Implement test steps from feature file:
  - [x] Setup tutorial mode state
  - [x] Test "Enter" key input
  - [x] Test "fdsa" key sequence
  - [x] Test "jkl;" key sequence
  - [x] Verify activity state change
- [ ] Verify test execution and fix any issues

Progress:
- Created initial test implementation in src/e2e/__tests__/tutorialProgression.test.tsx
- Test follows the feature file scenario steps
- Uses React Testing Library for DOM interactions
- Verifies activity state changes using signals
- Next step: Run test and fix any issues that arise
