title: Tutorial Test Manual Verification
---

# Task
Verify tutorial test behavior and improve test reliability, following up on [2025-01-06-tutorial-test-improvements-3.md](2025-01-06-tutorial-test-improvements-3.md).

# Problem Understanding
Manual testing revealed:
1. Browser_action tool limitations:
   - Can't properly simulate keyboard events
   - Types "Enter" literally instead of sending Enter key
   - Not suitable for testing tutorial sequence

2. Test sequence requirements:
   - Need proper keyboard focus
   - Need proper Enter key events
   - Need state verification between steps

# Implementation Notes

## Test Execution
The tests should be run directly with Playwright:
```bash
npm run test:e2e --debug
```

This provides:
- Proper keyboard event simulation
- Better state management
- More detailed logging

## Key Test Points to Verify
1. Initial Tutorial:
   - Terminal gets proper focus
   - Enter key properly processed
   - State transitions correctly

2. Tutorial Sequence:
   - fdsa tutorial completes
   - jkl; tutorial completes
   - Game mode transition works
   - Returns to tutorial properly

## Debugging Output
The test now provides detailed state logging:
```typescript
const state = await page.evaluate(() => ({
  tutorialSignal: window.tutorialSignal?.value,
  activitySignal: window.activitySignal?.value,
  completedTutorials: localStorage.getItem('completed-tutorials'),
  tutorialState: localStorage.getItem('tutorial-state')
}));
console.log(`[${label}]`, state);
```

This helps identify:
- Current tutorial state
- Activity transitions
- Completion status
- Any state inconsistencies

# Next Steps
1. Run tests with Playwright directly
2. Monitor state transitions in debug output
3. Verify keyboard events are properly processed
4. Check for any timing issues between steps
