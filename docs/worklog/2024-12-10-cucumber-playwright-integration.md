## Test Isolation Strategy

### Browser Context Isolation

We handle test isolation through Playwright's browser context configuration rather than manual storage clearing:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: {
        ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
        contextOptions: {
          storageState: undefined  // Fresh context for each test
        }
      },
    }
  ]
});
```

This approach:
- Creates a fresh context for each test
- Handles all storage types (localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies)
- Avoids security issues with direct storage access
- Works consistently across all browser types

### Test Implementation

With context isolation configured, test files remain clean and focused on behavior:

```typescript
// tutorial.spec.ts
test.describe('Tutorial Progression', () => {
  let tutorialPage: TutorialPage;

  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    tutorialPage = new TutorialPage(page);
    await tutorialPage.goto();
  });

  test('should progress from tutorial to game mode', async () => {
    await expect(tutorialPage.tutorialMode).toBeVisible();
    // Test steps...
  });

  test('should start in tutorial mode with clean state', async () => {
    // Each test gets a fresh context automatically
    await expect(tutorialPage.tutorialMode).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Benefits

1. **Reliability**
   - Each test runs in complete isolation
   - No state persistence between tests
   - Consistent across browsers
   - No race conditions or ordering issues

2. **Security**
   - Avoids direct storage manipulation
   - Works with all security contexts
   - No permission issues or SecurityErrors

3. **Simplicity**
   - No need for manual storage clearing
   - Handled at configuration level
   - Cleaner test code
   - Less maintenance overhead

4. **Performance**
   - More efficient than manual storage clearing
   - Parallel test execution friendly
   - No overhead from storage manipulation

### Best Practices

1. **Configuration**
   - Set contextOptions in playwright.config.ts
   - Apply to all browser projects
   - Keep configuration consistent

2. **Test Structure**
   - Focus on behavior, not state management
   - Use beforeEach for test setup
   - Keep tests independent
   - Don't rely on shared state

3. **Page Objects**
   - Encapsulate page interactions
   - Handle element selection
   - Provide high-level actions
   - Keep implementation details hidden
