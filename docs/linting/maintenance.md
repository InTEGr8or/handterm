## Maintenance

When encountering linting errors:

1. **Understand the Rule**
   - Read the rule documentation
   - Understand why it exists
   - Consider the benefits it provides

2. **Fix the Code**
   - Improve the code to meet the standard
   - Don't disable rules without strong justification
   - Document any necessary exceptions

3. **Review Impact**
   - Consider if similar issues exist elsewhere
   - Update related code for consistency
   - Add tests if needed

4. **Documentation**
   - Update comments if needed
   - Document any non-obvious patterns
   - Share learnings with the team

Remember: The goal is to improve code quality, not to make the linter happy. When you encounter a linting error, ask "How can I make this code better?" rather than "How can I make this error go away?"
