# End-to-End Testing for Handterm

## Testing Philosophy

This E2E testing approach focuses on describing test scenarios in a human-readable, terse English language that can be easily expanded into executable test code.

### Example Test Description Format

```
Scenario: User logs in and starts a typing game
Given the user is on the home page
When the user clicks "Login"
And enters valid GitHub credentials
Then the user should be redirected to the game dashboard
And the typing game should be available
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. Use a custom parser to convert these descriptions into executable test cases
2. Leverage React Testing Library and Vitest for test execution
3. Provide clear, reproducible test scenarios that cover key user flows
