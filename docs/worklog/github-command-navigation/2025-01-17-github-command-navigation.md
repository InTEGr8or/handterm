# GitHub Command Navigation Worklog
Date: 2025-01-17

## Task Description
The GitHubCommand `github -t` should:
1. Load one level of the GitHub tree of a repo into localStorage
2. Use navigationUtils to navigate to a URL with `activity=tree` in the querystring parameters

Current issues:
- The `navigate` command is not working as expected
- The e2e test in `e2e/monaco-tree-view.spec.ts` is not detecting `activity=tree` in querystring parameters

## Plan
1. Investigate GitHubCommand.ts implementation
2. Examine navigationUtils functionality
3. Review e2e test cases in monaco-tree-view.spec.ts
4. Fix navigation functionality
5. Update tests to verify correct behavior

## Worklog
- [x] Added navigationUtils.js to tsconfig.eslint.json include patterns
- [x] Implemented type safety improvements in navigationUtils:
  - Separated ActivityType import from signals to types
  - Added null safety checks for contentKey and groupKey
  - Improved localStorage state handling
  - Fixed type imports and usage
- [ ] Initial investigation of GitHubCommand.ts
- [x] Create a Playwright spec file to implement `src/e2e/scenarios/github-command-navigation.feature`

- [x] Review navigationUtils implementation
- [ ] Analyze e2e test failures
- [ ] Implement fixes
- [ ] Verify test coverage

### Type Safety Improvements
- **Changes Made:**
  - Separated type imports from implementation
  - Added null checks for critical navigation keys
  - Improved localStorage state handling
  - Fixed type imports and usage
- **Impact:**
  - Better type safety and null handling
  - Reduced risk of runtime errors
  - Improved code maintainability
  - More predictable navigation behavior
- **Next Steps:**
  - Review related navigation code for similar improvements
  - Update tests to verify new type safety checks
  - Document navigation patterns in CONVENTIONS.md

### Test Configuration Changes
- Separated test setup into:
  - setupTests.ts for vitest configuration
  - e2e/setup.ts for Playwright configuration
- Removed Playwright-specific setup from setupTests.ts
- Added proper type declarations for window methods
