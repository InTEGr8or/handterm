title: Tutorial Activity Transition Analysis

# Task
Analyze and potentially refactor the activity mode transition logic between Tutorial and Game modes in useTutorial.ts

# Problem Understanding
- The current implementation may be incorrectly flipping back to Tutorial mode after progressing to Game
- Need to verify if the useEffect is necessary or if activity mediation should be handled by a parent component
- Must align with the progression spec in tutorialProgression.feature

# Analysis
- The useEffect in useTutorial.ts is necessary to keep the tutorial state in sync
- The activity mediation logic in useActivityMediator.ts correctly implements the progression spec
- Moving this logic to a parent component would add unnecessary complexity
- The current implementation correctly handles the cyclical progression between tutorial and game modes

# Changes Implemented
- Modified handleCommand in useCommand.ts to better handle activity state transitions
- Added additional logging to track activity state during command execution
- Ensured tutorial progress check only occurs when explicitly in tutorial mode
- Added timestamp logging for better debugging of activity transitions
- Improved activity state tracking

# Conclusion
- The useEffect in useTutorial.ts is properly placed
- The activity mediation logic is correctly handled in useActivityMediator.ts
- Command handling now properly respects activity state transitions
- Additional logging helps track activity state transitions
