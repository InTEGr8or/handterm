# Rebuild Edit Command AWS Integration

## Task
Recreate tests and features for the edit command's AWS file operations that were lost during refactoring.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Created AWS File Operation Utilities ✅
1. Created `src/utils/awsApiClient.ts`:
   - Implemented getFile and putFile operations
   - Added proper error handling and types
   - Reused authentication handling from existing apiClient

2. Created `src/hooks/useAWSAPI.ts`:
   - Wrapped AWS API operations in React hook
   - Added proper state management
   - Provided file operation methods to components

### Phase 2: Updated Edit Command Implementation ✅
1. Modified `src/commands/editCommand.tsx`:
   - Replaced localStorage with AWS file operations
   - Added proper error handling
   - Maintained existing activity navigation behavior

### Phase 3: Rebuilt Tests Incrementally ✅

1. Unit Tests:
   - Created `src/__tests__/utils/awsApiClient.test.ts` for API utilities
   - Created `src/__tests__/hooks/useAWSAPI.test.ts` for hook testing
   - Created `src/__tests__/commands/editCommand.test.ts` for command testing
   - Added comprehensive error handling tests

2. E2E Tests:
   - Created `src/e2e/tests/edit-command-aws.spec.ts` for AWS integration testing
   - Added mocked AWS responses
   - Tested full command workflow
   - Verified proper navigation and error handling

3. Legacy Test Handling:
   - Marked old localStorage tests as skipped
   - Added documentation for transition period
   - Will remove once AWS integration is fully deployed

### Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup ✅
1. Updated documentation in worklog
2. Added TODO comments for legacy code removal
3. Maintained backward compatibility during transition

## Next Steps

1. Deployment and Verification
   - Deploy changes to staging environment
   - Verify AWS integration works with real AWS endpoints
   - Monitor for any issues or performance concerns

2. Legacy Code Cleanup
   - Remove localStorage fallback after successful deployment
   - Remove skipped localStorage tests
   - Update any remaining documentation

3. Future Improvements
   - Consider adding retry logic for network operations
   - Add file operation progress indicators
   - Consider caching frequently accessed files
   - Add file operation conflict resolution

## Notes
- All core functionality has been implemented and tested
- Maintained backward compatibility during transition
- Added proper error handling throughout
- Used TypeScript types consistently
- Followed existing patterns from GitHub integration
- Tests cover both success and error scenarios
- E2E tests verify full workflow
