# Activity Mediator Fix - 2025-01-19

## Problem
The useActivityMediator hook had failing tests due to signal subscription handling issues. The main problems were:
1. Improper typing of subscription return values
2. Missing cleanup handling for signal subscriptions

## Solution
Fixed the signal subscription handling in useTutorialState.ts by:
1. Properly typing the subscription return value
2. Adding proper cleanup handling in the useEffect hook

## Results
- All useActivityMediator tests now pass
- Signal subscriptions are properly cleaned up
- Tutorial state management is more reliable

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any related issues in production
- Consider adding additional tests for edge cases
- Review e2e test configuration issues separately
