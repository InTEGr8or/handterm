# Activity Mediator Fix - 2025-01-19

## Task
Fix failing test in `useActivityMediator.test.ts` and simplify the `useActivityMediator` hook implementation.

## Problem
The second test in `useActivityMediator.test.ts` was failing due to improper initialization of activity mode when the tutorial was marked as complete.

## Solution
Modified the `useActivityMediator` hook to:
1. Check localStorage for completed-tutorials during initialization
2. Properly initialize to NORMAL mode when tutorial is complete

## Results
- Both tests in `useActivityMediator.test.ts` now pass
- Hook behavior matches expected functionality from feature scenarios
- Code is more maintainable with proper initialization checks

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any related issues in production
- Consider additional refactoring opportunities if complexity increases
