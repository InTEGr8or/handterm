# E2E Testing Strategy for Handterm TUI

## Date: 2024-12-06

### Context
After careful consideration of the project's testing needs, we've developed a focused E2E testing approach that prioritizes the most critical interactions in the Text-Based User Interface (TUI).

### Testing Philosophy
- Prioritize complex interaction scenarios
- Focus on state transitions and core user workflows
- Verify signal-based state management
- Ensure robust activity switching mechanisms

### Key Testing Areas
1. Activity Switching
   - Validate transitions between NORMAL, TUTORIAL, GAME modes
   - Verify computed signal states
   - Test edge cases in mode changes

2. Phrase Interaction
   - Confirm phrase loading in different modes
   - Validate NextCharsDisplay behavior
   - Ensure correct phrase selection mechanisms

### Rationale for Current Approach
- Login testing deemed less critical due to straightforward implementation
- Focus shifted to more complex TUI interactions
- Emphasis on state management and user experience flows

### Technical Implementation
- Utilized Vitest for test framework
- Implemented custom E2E test runner
- Leveraged signal-based state tracking
- Created descriptive, step-by-step test scenarios

### Future Improvement Opportunities
- Expand test coverage for EDIT mode
- Add more complex interaction scenarios
- Potentially integrate with actual command interactions
- Develop more comprehensive NextCharsDisplay testing

### Lessons Learned
- Signal-based state management provides clear testing opportunities
- Descriptive testing improves understanding of complex interactions
- Focusing on core user workflows yields more meaningful tests

### Recommendations
- Continuously refine testing approach
- Maintain focus on user experience critical paths
- Develop tests that capture the essence of TUI interactions
